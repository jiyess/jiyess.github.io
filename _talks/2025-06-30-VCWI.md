Transferring academic research into real-world engineering applications is a complex yet rewarding journey. In this talk, I will share my personal experience of transforming fundamental research in geometry modeling and simulation into practical technologies that directly support industrial design workflows.

As a co-developer of G+Smo and the leading developer of SplineMesh, I have contributed to creating open and extensible software tools that enable precise geometry representation, robust simulation, and integrated design-through-analysis pipelines. These tools have been adopted in twin-screw compressor design, demonstrating the tangible impact of research-driven innovation.

Through this journey, I will reflect on key lessons learned in technology transferâ€”how to translate theoretical advances into usable software, how to collaborate effectively across academia and industry, and how open-source development can accelerate innovation in computational engineering.
