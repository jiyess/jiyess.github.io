High-quality structured mesh generation is essential for the accurate numerical simulation and design optimization of twin-screw compressors, widely used in high-pressure gas production. This paper presents Spline Mesh v2.0, an optimized and high-efficiency spline-based structured mesh generator specifically designed for twin-screw compressors.

Building upon the foundation of its predecessor, Spline Mesh v2.0 introduces significant enhancements in computational performance while preserving geometric fidelity. Key advancements include a refined boundary correspondence algorithm for improved profile accuracy, optimized elliptic grid generation techniques, and an accelerated solver framework employing block-diagonal Jacobian preconditioning with Anderson acceleration. These developments ensure faster convergence and substantial reductions in computational time without compromising mesh quality.

Developed using the open-source Geometry + Simulation Modules (G+Smo) library, Spline Mesh v2.0 seamlessly integrates with Isogeometric Analysis (IGA)-based workflows. Performance benchmarks validate its capability to generate high-quality structured meshes more efficiently, meeting stringent requirements for design optimization and CFD simulations. This release establishes Spline Mesh v2.0 as a powerful and reliable tool for advancing the simulation and design of screw compressors.
