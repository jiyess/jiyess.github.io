High-quality, analysis-suitable parameterization is a prerequisite for robust isogeometric analysis (IGA), especially in domains with thin air-gaps, sliding interfaces, and pronounced anisotropy as found in rotating machinery and electrical machines. This talk presents a suite of optimization- and PDE-based techniques to generate bijective, low-distortion parameterizations directly from CAD boundary descriptions. Key ingredients include barrier/penalty formulations for hard bijectivity, Jacobian-determinant regularization for distortion control, and adaptive strategies that respond to geometric and field-driven features. The methodology is demonstrated on challenging industrial geometries such as twin-screw compressorsâ€”representative of rotating machinery with narrow clearances.
