High-quality structured mesh generation is essential for the numerical simulation and design optimization of screw machines, particularly rotary twin-screw compressors used in high-pressure gas production. Existing meshing techniques often struggle to accurately capture their intricate geometries, limiting their application potential. This paper proposes a novel Isogeometric Analysis (IGA)-based mesh generation approach specifically tailored for twin-screw compressors. Our method leverages high-order Bspline parameterizations derived from boundary representations to enable efficient and precise mesh generation. A novel boundary correspondence technique using Schwarz-Christoffel mapping is introduced to further enhance mesh quality and preserve critical profile features. Additionally, we integrate elliptic grid generation techniques within the IGA framework, combined with a block-diagonal Jacobianpreconditioned Anderson acceleration algorithm, to efficiently solve the associated nonlinear systems. This approach, built upon the open source Geometry + Simulation Modules (G+Smo) library, demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality structured meshes that meet stringent requirements for screw machine simulations, providing a viable alternative for design optimization.
