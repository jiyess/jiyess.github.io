This talk will introduce robust parameterization methodologies, particularly through the generation of high-quality domain parameterizations from CAD boundary representations, utilizing and transcending the capabilities of G+Smo. We commence with an exploration of barrier-type optimization-based methods and PDE-driven parameterization techniques, which have carved a niche in industry, particularly in mesh generation for complex machinery such as twin-screw compressors.

We then pivot to the pivotal aspect of boundary correspondence, a linchpin in modeling the nuanced dynamics of fluid flow within slender and extended geometries. An innovative adoption of Schwarz-Christoffel mapping will be unveiled, showcasing its potential to preserve the fidelity of geometric features during parameterization. This is instrumental in achieving precision in fluid dynamics simulations and enhancing optimization processes.
