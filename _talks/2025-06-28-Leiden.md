In the IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA)-based Design-Through-Analysis (DTA) pipeline, generating a high-quality, analysis-suitable domain parameterization from the boundary representation of a CAD model is a critical step. This process significantly impacts subsequent tasks, including simulation and structural design optimization. This presentation highlights several analysis-suitable parameterization techniques developed in recent years. The proposed algorithms have been successfully applied in both academic research and industrial settings. Additionally, parts of the developed code have been open-sourced in the Geometry + Simulation Modules (G+Smo) library, an open-source C++ toolkit for geometric design and isogeometric simulations.
