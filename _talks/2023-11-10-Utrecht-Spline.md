This study aims to present potential advancements in geometry modeling techniques for both energy efficiency for volumetric compressors and precision in contact modeling for railway vehicle dynamics. Rotating volumetric compressors, which use 15% of all the electricity used in industrial operations, are essential to many industrial processes. Leakage fluxes through rotor gaps have been recognized as the main cause of energy losses, and a minor increase in their efficiency can lead to significant energy savings. Mesh creation for twin-screw machines is given special consideration because it is essential for comprehending and managing leakage flows. This poster offers an exploration of diverse mesh generation techniques tailored for computational fluid dynamics in twin-screw machines, opening up the possibility of design optimization to reduce leakage and improve performance. We explore the challenges and solutions related to geometry modeling for the wheel-rail contact problem in the second section of the poster. In order to address problems with wheel-rail interaction, the primary emphasis is on providing insights from a geometry modeling standpoint. The application of advanced THB-spline techniques is highlighted, demonstrating their capability to enhance the performance and accuracy of our modeling approach.
