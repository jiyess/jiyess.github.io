In the IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA) based Design-Through-Analysis (DTA) pipeline, the construction of high-quality, analysis-suitable parameterizations from CAD boundary representations is a crucial step. The quality of parameterization directly affects simulation robustness, numerical accuracy, and the efficiency of design optimization. This talk presents recent advances in analysis-suitable parameterization techniques, covering both theoretical developments and algorithmic implementations. Applications to benchmark problems and industrial case studies will be discussed, demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods in bridging the gap between CAD models and IGA simulations.
