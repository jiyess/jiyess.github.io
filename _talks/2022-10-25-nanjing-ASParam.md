Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a well-known computational paradigm to integrate geometry modeling and numerical simulation analysis using consistent mathematical representation. In IGA, constructing high-quality analysis-suitable parameterizations from no more than a description of the boundary representation is a fundamental task. In this talk, we present two robust and efficient parameterization methods.
