    abstract = {NURBS method is the standard mathematical method for describing the shapes of curves/surfaces/volumes, and it is extensively used in computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, and computer graphics. The injectivity of NURBS volumes means that they do not have self-intersections. Since the injectivity of parameterizations depend on the signs of their Jacobian functions, and the Jacobian of a NURBS volume is determined by the determinant of its tangent vectors in three directions, we first propose a method to compute the bounding vectors of the tangent cones of NURBS volume in this paper. Then the sufficient condition for the injectivity of NURBS volume is proposed. A checking algorithm is also presented. Some examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

PDE-based elliptic grid generation is an effective method for generating high-quality parameterizations with rapid convergence properties for the planar case.

In the present work, we introduce a novel scaled discretization of harmonic mappings in the Sobolev space $H^1$ to remit it. Analytical Jacobian matrices for the involved nonlinear equations are derived to accelerate the computation. To enhance the numerical stability and the speed of convergence, we propose a simple and yet effective preconditioned Anderson acceleration framework instead of using computationally expensive Newton-type iteration. Three preconditioning strategies are suggested, namely diagonal Jacobian, block-diagonal Jacobian, and full Jacobian. Furthermore, we discuss a delayed update strategy of the preconditioner, i.e., the preconditioner is updated every few steps to reduce the computational cost per iteration. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our improved parameterization approach and the computational efficiency of our preconditioned Anderson acceleration scheme.},

    abstract = {Generalized B{\'e}zier (GB) surfaces proposed by V{\'a}rady et al. are a multi-sided general- ization of classical tensor product B{\'e}zier surfaces with a simple control structure and inherit most of the nice properties from B{\'e}zier surfaces. However, the original degree elevation changes the geometry of GB surfaces such that it is undesirable in many applications, e.g., isogeometric analysis (IGA). In this paper, we propose an improved degree elevation algo- rithm for GB surfaces keeping not only the geometry but also the parameter consistency. Based on the knot insertion of B-splines, a novel knot insertion algorithm for GB surface is also proposed. Then the proposed degree elevation and knot insertion algorithms are employed to increase the degree of freedom (DOF) for multi-sided domain parameterized by GB surface in IGA, corresponding to the traditional p-, h-, and k-refinements. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.},

    abstract = {Modeling and analysis of stiffened panels are two key technologies in the design of aerospace thin-walled structures. For the stiffened panels with complex geometry, classical finite element analysis (FEA) and conventional isogeometric analysis (IGA) based on explicit geometry usually require time-consuming and labor-intensive geometric processing, and additional coupling matrices to be ready for analysis. In this study, a new method for modeling and buckling analysis of stiffened panels is proposed, which provides a more efficient and simpler way. During the modeling process, the stiffeners are treated as curves on surfaces, which is not explicitly defined using the control-point-based representation of curves, but implicitly defined using parameter curves in the parametric space of the surface. Mapping modeling provides more accurate geometric description and transfer the complex modeling problems (three-dimensional space) of stiffeners on free-form surface into simple modeling problems in the regular parametric space (two-dimensional space). During the buckling analysis process, a new mapped stiffener element based on mapping modeling is proposed, which can model the section of the eccentric stiffener without changing the geometry. The precise normal information of the Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) surface can ensure that the stiffeners are perpendicular to the skin. In addition, the coupling of the stiffener and the skin is automatic, without any additional coupling matrix. This buckling analysis framework realizes the complete integration of modeling and analysis. Furthermore, for the stiffened panels with cutouts, the trimmed surface analysis (TSA) method is extended to be used for the numerical integration of the trimmed stiffeners, which means that no additional geometric process is required. Finally, four numerical examples of different types of stiffened panels are constructed, involving metal, trimmed surface, classical grid-stiffener, free-form surface, variable-stiffness composites, and curvilinear grid-stiffener. Several numerical examples of static and buckling analysis of stiffened panels with high fidelity demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

    abstract = {Localized and anisotropic features extensively exist in various physical phenomena. The present work focuses on the r-adaptive parameterization technique for isogeometric analysis (IGA), which aims to acquire higher numerical accuracy while keeping the degrees of freedom constant. The principal feature is utilizing the so-called absolute principal curvature of the IGA solution surfaces to characterize numerical errors instead of posteriori error estimations, which establishes the relation between analysis results and geometric quantity. The bijectivity is a fundamental requirement for analysis-suitable parameterization. With the cooperation of a minor regularization and common line search criteria, the proposed method guarantees the bijectivity of the resulting parameterizations. The bi-level approach with two refinement levels of the same geometry is employed: a coarse level (design model) to update the parameterization and a fine level (analysis model) to perform the isogeometric simulation. Moreover, we develop several detailed algorithms for explaining the sensitivity propagation from the design model to the analysis model and analytically computing the sensitivity, which allows accurate calculation of sensitivity and enhances the robustness during a gradient-based optimization. Several examples and comparisons are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. As an application, we apply the proposed method to a two-dimensional linear heat transfer problem with a moving Gaussian heat source, which is a simplified model for the additive manufacturing application. The proposed r-adaptive technique effectively captures the thermal history of the problem.},

    abstract = {In isogeometric analysis, constructing bijective and low-distorted parameterizations is a fundamental task. Compared with the planar problem, the volumetric case is more challenging in both robustness and efficiency. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient volumetric parameterization method based on the idea of penalty functions and the Jacobian regularization technique. The proposed method does not require an already bijective initialization and thus avoids an extra foldover elimination step. The main contributions of this work lie in three aspects. First, a new objective function that characterizes the volume distortion is established using the Divergence Theorem. Second, we employ a novel penalty function for the Jacobian regularization. The full analytical gradient of the objective function is also deduced to enhance the numerical stability in gradient-based optimization. Third, we develop a reduced numerical integration strategy to accelerate the new algorithm. Several numerical examples demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the current competitive approaches both in terms of robustness and efficiency.},

Based on these conditions, an algorithm for the injectivity checking of NURBS parameterization is proposed. By taking both the internal control points and weights as optimization variables, we present an effective and robust approach for parameterizing planar computational domains.
