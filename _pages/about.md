Ye Ji is Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics/numerical-analysis" target="_blank">Numerical Analysis group</a> of the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics" target="_blank">Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM)</a>, <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs" target="_blank">Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics & Computer Science (EEMCS)</a>, at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/" target="_blank">Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</a>.

Specializing in **Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)**, Ye's work bridges the disciplines of applied mathematics, computer science, and engineering to address intricate, real-world challenges. His research is particularly concentrated on **Computer-Aided Geometry Design (CAGD)** and **IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA)**, with a focus on advancing the theoretical underpinnings and developing efficient methodologies for **spline-based analysis-suitable parameterization**, **mesh generation**, and **geometric modelling**. This specialized area is a pivotal component of IGA that has significant ramifications for downstream simulation analysis. More recently, Ye also started focusing on fast and robust **structured mesh generation** for twin-screw machines, which are extensively employed in industries to produce high-pressure air and gases.

In addition to his research, Ye contributes to the academic community by serving as a reviewer for Mathematical Reviews. He is also a co-developer of [Geometry + Simulation Modules (G+Smo)](https://gismo.github.io/), a prominent open-source C++ software platform for isogeometric analysis.
