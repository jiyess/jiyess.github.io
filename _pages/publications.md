[[**Full Article**]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042723002479) [DOI: 10.1016/j.cam.2023.115303](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2023.115303)

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  NURBS method is the standard mathematical method for describing the shapes of curves/surfaces/volumes, and it is extensively used in computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, and computer graphics. The injectivity of NURBS volumes means that they do not have self-intersections. This paper first proposes a method to compute the bounding vectors of the tangent cones of NURBS volume and then presents a sufficient condition for the injectivity of NURBS volume. A checking algorithm is also presented.

"Isogeometric analysis for trimmed CAD surfaces using multi-sided toric surface patches." *Computer Aided Geometric Design*, 79, 101847. [DOI: 10.1016/j.cagd.2020.101847](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cagd.2020.101847) [**Full Article**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167839620300340)

    <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
    We propose a new isogeometric method using Toric surface patches for trimmed CAD planar surfaces. This method converts each trimmed spline element into a Toric surface patch with conforming boundary representation and converts each non-trimmed spline element into a Bézier element. Because the Toric surface patches are a multi-sided generalization of classical Bézier surface patches, all trimmed and non-trimmed elements of a trimmed CAD surface have a unified geometric representation using Toric surface patches.
