# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you want to use Jekyll native, uncomment the line below.
# To upgrade, run `bundle update`.

# gem "jekyll"

gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.0" if Gem.win_platform?

# NOTE: GitHub Pages builds this site with its own fixed github-pages gem set
# (Jekyll 3.x). That old Jekyll does not run on modern Ruby, so for LOCAL
# preview use Gemfile.local (modern Jekyll 4) via ./serve.sh — see README.

# If you have any plugins, put them here!

  # gem "jekyll-archives"
