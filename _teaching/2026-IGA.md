## Course overview

**Isogeometric Analysis (IGA)** is a computational methodology that tightly integrates *Computer-Aided Design (CAD)* and *Finite Element Analysis (FEA)* by using spline-based functions—such as **B-splines** and **NURBS**—for both geometry representation and numerical simulation.

By enabling higher-order smoothness and exact geometry representation, IGA provides significant advantages over classical finite element methods, particularly for applications involving:

- fluid and solid mechanics,
- multi-physics coupling,
- shape and topology optimization.

Originally motivated by practical engineering challenges, IGA has developed a strong theoretical foundation over the past two decades. This course aims to strike a balance between **mathematical foundations**, **computational techniques**, and **engineering applications** of IGA.

## Learning objectives

After completing this course, students will be able to:

- understand spline-based geometry representations and their role in numerical analysis,
- formulate and solve linear and nonlinear PDEs using IGA,
- implement collocation- and Galerkin-based IGA methods,
- apply IGA to physics and optimization problems,
- critically assess the strengths and limitations of IGA in practical applications.
